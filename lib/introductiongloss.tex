Instead, the address space is laid out in a unique manner every time the program is used.}

    description={A stack cookie, also known as a stack canary is a security mechanism used to detect stack buffer overflow attacks. It involves placing a random value between the local variables and the function return address on the stack. The canary value is checked when the function returns to ensure that it has not been modified by an attacker. If the canary value has been altered, then it is assumed that a buffer overflow attack has occurred.
